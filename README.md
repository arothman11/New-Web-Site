Feel free to create a new username, or log in as u1, u2, u3, or u4 (for these accounts, the passwords are the same as the usernames).

Creative Portion:
After talking to TA's Clay Mudter & Sam Winiarksi, we decided to implement the following:
  - Users can click on their own username or other usernames to access a user profile page that shows all of that user's posts, and users can edit and delete their posts from their own user profile page. 
  - Users can edit their post titles and links in addition to the stories.
  - User accounts can be deleted. This will also delete all of the user's posts and comments. 
  - When a user posts a story, we check to make sure the link it actually a legitimate URL. A post on Piazza said this would count for the creative portion.
